This report presents the findings of the 2025 Turkey Software Sector Salary Survey conducted by the React Internship Group. The objective is to measure salary distributions, evaluate the impact of key explanatory variables (technology stack, work arrangement, company location, career level, gender), and provide actionable insights for individuals, companies, and the broader ecosystem.

The study follows a transparent and reproducible pipeline: raw survey data were cleaned and transformed into an analysis-ready dataset; primary and secondary statistical analyses were conducted; over twenty publication-quality visualizations were produced; and an interactive Streamlit dashboard was implemented to facilitate exploration. This document consolidates the methodology, key results, and recommendations, and is intended to be read as the scientific companion to the business-oriented summaries.
