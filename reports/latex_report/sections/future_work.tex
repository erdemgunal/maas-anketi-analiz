Building upon the findings of this salary survey, we outline two focused directions for future work that align with the project documentation and practical next steps:

\subsection*{Comparison with Global Benchmarks}

\textbf{Stack Overflow Dataset Alignment:} Compare key metrics (salary distribution, technology usage, work arrangement effects, gender gap) with recent global Stack Overflow Developer Survey data. This will contextualize findings, quantify similarities/differences, and identify where local patterns diverge from global benchmarks.

\subsection*{Salary Prediction Model}

\textbf{Predictive Modeling:} Develop a transparent, reproducible salary prediction model using the cleaned dataset. Begin with interpretable baselines (regularized linear models, GAMs), then evaluate tree-based approaches (Random Forest, XGBoost) with careful cross-validation. Report performance (MAE/RMSE), feature importance, calibration, and fairness diagnostics (e.g., group-wise error).

These two directions provide high-impact, tractable extensions that directly build on the current analysis without introducing unnecessary scope or complexity.
