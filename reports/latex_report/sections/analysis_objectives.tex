We address questions prioritized for stakeholders:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
  \item What does the overall salary distribution look like, and which factors exhibit the strongest association with salary?
  \item Is React usage associated with higher pay after controlling for other factors descriptively?
  \item How do work arrangements (remote, office, hybrid) compare in terms of salary levels?
  \item How does company location relate to salary outcomes?
  \item Is there a measurable gender pay gap in the sample, and what is its magnitude?
  \item Which technology stacks correlate with higher pay, and what are their relative effect sizes (stack ROI)?
  \item How do salary levels evolve across career progression (Junior $\rightarrow$ Mid $\rightarrow$ Senior)?
\end{enumerate}
