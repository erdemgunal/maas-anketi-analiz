Analyses were implemented in Python using pandas, NumPy, SciPy, statsmodels, seaborn, and matplotlib. Reproducibility is supported via versioned source files in \texttt{src/}, notebooks in \texttt{notebooks/}, and pinned dependencies in \texttt{requirements.txt}. Interactive exploration is provided by a Streamlit app (\texttt{app.py}).
