Work proceeded in five sprints, each with well-defined deliverables: data preparation; core hypothesis testing; secondary analyses and visualization drafts; publication-quality visualization and dashboard; and final reporting. All sprint objectives and outputs are documented in the project plan and associated markdown files under \texttt{docs/}.
